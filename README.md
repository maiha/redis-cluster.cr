[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/maiha/redis-cluster.cr.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/maiha/redis-cluster.cr)

redis-cluster library for [Crystal](http://crystal-lang.org/).

- crystal: 0.26.1

## Classes

- Redis : a redis standard client (stefanwille/crystal-redis)
- Redis::Cluster : a redis cluster client (in this library)
- Redis::Client : a hybrid proxy to above clients (in this library)

## Supported API

See [API](https://github.com/maiha/redis-cluster.cr/blob/master/API.md)

## Installation

Add this to your application's `shard.yml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  redis-cluster:
    github: maiha/redis-cluster.cr
    version: 0.8.1
```

## Usage

### Redis::Cluster client

- assumes that our cluster is runing on localhost:7001 and 7002, ...

```crystal
require "redis-cluster"

bootstrap = "127.0.0.1:7001,127.0.0.1:7002"
cluster = Redis::Cluster.new(bootstrap)
# cluster = Redis::Cluster.new(bootstrap, password: "secret")

cluster.set "foo", "123"
cluster.get "foo"         # => "123"
cluster.counts.values     # => [0, 0, 1]

cluster.close
```

#### methods

See [crystal-redis](https://github.com/stefanwille/crystal-redis) because most of all methods are thin proxy to it.

### Redis client (enhancement)

This library also add some features to standard `Redis` libarary.
- [src/ext/redis/commands.cr](src/ext/redis/commands.cr)

### Redis::Client

This class is a high level hybrid client which can speak to both
standard and clustered redis nodes. And it also has a reconnecting feature.
Well, we don't care anything about the node is restarted or clustered or not. 

So, the following code works on either redis mode.

```crystal
redis = Redis::Client.new(host: "127.0.0.1", port: 6379)
redis.get("foo")
```

### multi and pipelined

`Redis::Client#multi` and `pipelined` requires a key to resolve redis node.
In standard redis, the information is just ignored but it is necessary for hybrid api.

```crystal
redis.pipelined("foo") do |api|
  api.set("foo", 1)
  api.set("bar", 2) # raises unless both "foo" and "bar" are in the same node
end
```

When `reconnect` option is set, operations will be executed once again after connection error or hash slot error.

```crystal
redis.pipelined("foo", reconnect: true) do |api|
  ...
```

### Redis#each

Handy `SCAN` especially for block.

```crystal
redis = Redis.new
redis.each(count: 1000) |key|
redis.each_keys(count: 1000) |keys|
```

## RESTRICTION

- `multi` needs `key` for its first arg to resolve master node

```crystal
redis.multi("foo1") do |multi|
  multi.set("foo1", "first")
  multi.set("foo2", "second")
end
```

## Roadmap

#### v0.8.0

- [ ] define method explicitly
- [x] Commands : Pipeline
